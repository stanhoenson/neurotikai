# Neurotikai

A theme based on [Monokai Pro](https://monokai.pro/) (Spectrum), but *tweaked by a neurotic*.

It is slightly more 'contrasty' than Monokai Pro (Spectrum).

## Tweaked by a neurotic?

Well, let me explain.

I prefer writing colors in the **HSL** format.
So, I copied the colors from Monokai Pro (Spectrum) and converted them to HSL.
The values were not *"perfect"*, as in the numbers were all over the place.
I like my values to be **round** and have **logical** steps up or down.

And that's all I did, I rounded the values and applied more logical steps up or down for the shades.

Take a look at the HSL file and you'll see what I've done.

## Ports

Currently it's only ported for [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) and [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/).
I'll add one for [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) in the near future.
And I also plan on adding ones for [st](https://st.suckless.org/) and [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) someday.
