# Neurotikai

A theme based on Monokai Pro (Spectrum), but tweaked by a neurotic.

## Tweaked by a neurotic?

Well, let me explain.

I prefer writing colors in the HSL format.
So, I copied the colors from Monokai Pro (Spectrum) and converted them to HSL.
The values were not "perfect", as in the numbers were all over the place.
I like my values to be round and have logical steps up or down.

And that's all I did, I rounded the values and applied more logical steps up or down for the shades.

Take a look at the HSL file and you'll see what I've done.
